## Projects
 1. **Rodent Control System** ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-%2320232a.svg?style=plastic&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=plastic&logo=react-router&logoColor=white) ![Ant-Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/-AntDesign-%230170FE?style=plastic&logo=ant-design&logoColor=white)
 
    This project is used to detect rodents in a building where expensive machinery is installed. Different types of sensors i.e. trap sensor, detection sensor, and bait   sensors are installed. These sensors are in sync with the backend system. I worked on the frontend that is created in React. The frontend has different dashboards based  on sensor types. It also shows different types of notifications regarding different events from sensors.The project is deployed on the client site and is actively maintained by me and other team members. New features are added on the frontend by me and bugs are also  resolved.
    
1. **Helperwise** ![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=plastic&logo=next.js&logoColor=white) ![React Query](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React%20Query-FF4154?style=plastic&logo=react%20query&logoColor=white) ![Styled Components](https://img.shields.io/badge/Styled--Components-DB7093?style=plastic&logo=styled-components&logoColor=white) ![Ant-Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/-AntDesign-%230170FE?style=plastic&logo=ant-design&logoColor=white)

    The purpose of this project is to connect employers with domestic workers i.e. babysitters, gardeners, drivers, etc. Employers will signup on the helpwersie and upload complete requirements regarding the job. Then they can see the profiles of workers matching their needs.
Workers also need to upload their complete information like skills, experience, nationality, etc.
I have worked along with another team member on the frontend which is based on React framework Nextjs.The project is still in the development phase.

    Tijari is a digital service providing a range of online services to the customers where they can do shopping, food delivery, bill payments, watch live tv, watch movies and request various corporate and government services online.
Project architecture is based on microservices, different services include IDM, Food, Ecommerce, BSS, Payment, Billing, Topup, etc.
During my job, I have worked on the admin and merchant portals from the front-end to the backend. I worked with Angular on front-end and Nodejs on the backend. REST/RESTful APIs were developed on the backend. I have also done API integration in Node.js with third parties like JazzCash (HPP), 1Link, TCS, and M&P Courier.
    
1. **Agent Network** ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-%23DD0031.svg?style=plastic&logo=angular&logoColor=white) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-6DA55F?style=plastic&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=plastic&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postgres-%23316192.svg?style=plastic&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redis-%23DD0031.svg?style=plastic&logo=redis&logoColor=white)

    Agent Network is about placing agents in the far away and less developed areas of Pakistan. These agents can help people to open financial accounts who do not have direct access to banks. I was part of the core technical team as the technical solution was built by SmartFusion. I worked both on the Angular front-end and Nodejs back-end.
