During my job, I have worked on the admin and merchant portals from the front-end to the backend. I worked with Angular on front-end and Nodejs on the backend. REST/RESTful APIs were developed on the backend. I have also done API integration in Node.js with third parties like JazzCash (HPP), 1Link, TCS, and M&P Courier.

    Agent Network is about placing agents in the far away and less developed areas of Pakistan. These agents can help people to open financial accounts who do not have direct access to banks. I was part of the core technical team as the technical solution was built by SmartFusion. I worked both on the Angular front-end and Nodejs back-end.
