## Projects
 1. **Rodent Control System**
 
    This project is used to detect rodents in a building where expensive machinery is installed. Different types of sensors i.e. trap sensor, detection sensor, and bait   sensors are installed. These sensors are in sync with the backend system. I worked on the frontend that is created in React. The frontend has different dashboards based  on sensor types. It also shows different types of notifications regarding different events from sensors.The project is deployed on the client site and is actively maintained by me and other team members. New features are added on the frontend by me and bugs are also  resolved.
    
1. **Helperwise**

    The purpose of this project is to connect employers with domestic workers i.e. babysitters, gardeners, drivers, etc. Employers will signup on the helpwersie and upload complete requirements regarding the job. Then they can see the profiles of workers matching their needs.
Workers also need to upload their complete information like skills, experience, nationality, etc.
I have worked along with another team member on the frontend which is based on React framework Nextjs.The project is still in the development phase.
