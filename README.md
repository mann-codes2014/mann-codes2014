    Agent Network is about placing agents in far away and less developed areas of Pakistan. These agents can help people to open financial accounts who do not have direct access to banks. I was part of the core technical team as SmartFusion built the technical solution. I worked both on the Angular front-end and Nodejs back-end.

I have worked on the React frontend portal for the support team and also developed the REST/RESTful APIs in the Node.js backend using MS SQL Server.
The system also generates some reports on the performance of the individuals based on their speed to resolve the tickets.
